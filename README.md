# velocity-pairing

Deployed [here](https://velocity-pairing.firebaseapp.com).

This app uses Firebase for persistence, and is implemented as a front-end React application. The Firebase project is under my (Kevin's) Google account, but we can move it if we want.

- Created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
- Uses [react-dnd](http://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/) for drag-and-drop behavior
- Uses the official [firebase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase) npm package for syncing with Firebase
